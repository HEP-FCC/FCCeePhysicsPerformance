## The total Z width

### Abstract

The Z total decay width ΓZ can be measured at FCC-ee with sample of 3.5 × 1012 Z → hadrons events produced around the Z pole at √s ≈ 87.8, 91.2, and 93.9 GeV, with a statistical precision of 4 keV [1]. Experience from LEP showed that a limiting systematic uncertainty comes from the uncorrelated point-to-point error on the centre-of-mass energies of the three resonance scan points. At FCC-ee, this error can possibly be controlled in situ with the invariant mass distributions obtained from large dimuon event samples [1]. The requirements of the detector design **(muon momentum and angular resolution and scale stability)** to match the statistical precision will be studied in the context of the constraints from the full interaction region layout (beam crossing angle, beam energy spread, magnetic field). As a by-product, the possible improvements brought about by a five-point scan of the Z resonance will be investigated.
